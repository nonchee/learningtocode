<p>
I would like to take these next 3 months to learn how to:
<ul>
  <li>Dress/pack for a hike</li>
  <li>Be in the present, rather than the future or the past (currently I'm at 'what does that even mean' levels of understanding what this means to me) </li>
</ul>

This is my blog where hopefully we'll see 3-month progression in both!
</p>

<p>
Short-term goals that will be fun to pursue: 
<ul>
  <li>Ride a bicycle</li>
  <li>Play barre chords on a small guitar</li>
  <li>Do chaturanga</li>
</ul>
</p>
